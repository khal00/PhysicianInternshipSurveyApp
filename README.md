Every year in Poland few thousends medical universities graduates starts a year long postgraduate internship in a medical institution of their choosing. During this practice they are obliged to fill the 9 pages of anonymous questionnaire where they rate the hospital, each of it's wards, tutors, courses, lecturers and different aspects of internship.

This application provides the functionality for physicians to sign in as a user and rate the appropriate part of internship (pediatrics, surgery etc.) in the questionnaire, then save it until next part of practice is finished. After completing the whole internship users can send the survey for acceptance by regional medical chamber administrators (this role is assigned by system administrators with cooperation with regional medical chambers - institutions which organizes the internship and collects the paper forms).

To ensure full anonimity and validity of forms (so that only real interns can take part in the survey) after sending the questionnaire application would assign random number to it, then the number should be provided by intern in given medical chamber (they need to visit this institution anyway after completing the practice). Medical chamber administrator then accepts validated questionnaire.

Results of aggregated data from accepted forms will be avaible on the website.
